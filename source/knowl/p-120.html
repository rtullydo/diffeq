<p><em class="alert">Problem:</em> A vat contains 60L of water with 5kg of salt water dissolved in it. A salt water solution that contains 2kg of salt per liter enters the vat at a rate of 3 L/min. Pure water is also flowing into the vat at a rate of 2 L/min. The solution in the vat is kept well mixed and is drained at a rate of 5 L/min, so that the rate in is the same as the rate out. Thus there is always 60L of salt water at any given time. How much salt is in the tank after 30 minutes? What is the long term behavior?</p>
