<p>Generally, there are three broad approaches to differential equations:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<em class="alert">Analytically:</em> This means that one actually finds a formula for the solutions of a differential equations, typically using integral techniques.</li>
<li>
<em class="alert">Numerically:</em> But often, it is very difficult to find an actual formula for the solution, even though there may be a solution. Thus one can use computers and algorithms to numerically approximate the solution. Even in the numerical case it is important to understand limitations of the calculated solutions.</li>
<li>
<em class="alert">Qualitatively:</em> Maybe we don't need the full solution of a differential equation. We can use our knowledge of ODEs to have an idea of how the solution behaves. For example, maybe the only thing you want to answer about the solution is what the following asymptotic limit is:<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{t\to\infty}y(t).
\end{equation*}
</div>
