<p>We being by asking what a differential equation is. In your calculus career, you have seen quite a number of them already, just in disguise. For example, you might have been asked “what function is the antiderivative of \(x^2\text{?}\)” In other words, find a function \(f(x)\) so that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = x^2.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In your past life, this sort of equation was solved by using integration, which will also be true in this class. Indeed, the reason that you spent so much time on techniques of integration was to give you the basic toolset needed to solve differential equations.</p>
