<p>Nonlinear ODEs are some of the hardest equations to solve! In fact, most of the time, one won't be able to find an exact formula for the solution of a differential equation. Much of the study of differential equations comes down to qualitative analysis and approximate solutions. But one nice thing about studying ODEs is that we can always check if a function is really a solution to a differential equation or not. Futhermore, the equations can frequently be understood without an explicit solution at all.</p>
