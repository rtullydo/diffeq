<p>Suppose an object with mass \(10\) kg is launched upward with initial velocity \(20\) m/s from a platform that is \(3\) meters high. Suppose there is a force due to air resistance of magnitude \(\left|v\right|\) directed opposite to the velocity, where the velocity \(v\) is measured in m/s. We neglect the variation of the earth's gravitational fields with distance. (Since it's not going very high anyways)</p>
