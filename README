This project comprises notes prepared by Phanuel Mariano for a first course in ordinary differential equations.
The notes largely follow Boyce and DiPrima's text, though certain areas have been expanded, and some areas are currently 
somwhat thin. Ryan Tully-Doyle edits, expands on, and prepares the original latex notes in the PreTeXt language, 
which are compiled to html (see https://pretextbook.org).

The current version of the notes can be seen rendered at http://math.newhaven.edu/rtullydo/diffeqs/diffeqs.html.
